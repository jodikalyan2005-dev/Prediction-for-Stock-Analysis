# Prediction-for-Stock-Analysis
  This project uses EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis) to uncover patterns and Machine Learning to generate actionable insights. The process involves data cleaning, feature engineering, training a predictive model (e.g., Classification/Regression), and visualization of key findings, culminating in clear business recommendations.
